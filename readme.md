1. Having a .file for storing features
1. entering a url or a file path.  With that be able to see all certificates found.
1. Viewing certificate issuer on all levels.
1. Viewing expire dates. 
1. Being able to view a trust file and see all trusted certs. Verify if a certificate would be validated for that
